1,"To ensure respondent confidentiality, estimates below a certain threshold are suppressed. For Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia suppression is applied to all data below 1,500. The threshold level for Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 500, while in Prince Edward Island, estimates under 200 are suppressed. For census subdivision (CSD), use their respective provincial suppression levels mentioned above. Estimates are based on smaller sample sizes the more detailed the table becomes, which could result in lower data quality.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2,"While labour force estimates are produced for these Census Subdivisions (CSDs), the LFS sample is not allocated specifically at this level of geography. Regular sample rotation within the larger Economic Regions (ERs) that contain these communities may cause the sample size within CSD boundaries to vary over time. As a result, data level movements may be due to real change, or they may be due to data variability from changes in sample size.",,,,,,,,,,,,
3,"The employment rate is the number of persons employed expressed as a percentage of the population 15 years of age and over. The employment rate for a particular group (age, gender, marital status, etcetera) is the number employed in that group expressed as a percentage of the population for that group. Estimates are percentages, rounded to the nearest tenth.",,,,,,,,,,,,
4,Census subdivision (CSD) is the general term for municipalities as determined by provincial/territorial legislation or areas treated as municipal equivalents for statistical purposes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
